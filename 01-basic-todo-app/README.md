# Basic todo-app

## Description of the project

This basic todo-app consists of an field to type the task you want to add and a button to add it.
Once you add a task you can remove it clicking the **remove** button.

Also I added a disabled state to the **add** button to prevent users from submitting empty tasks. This could be also be done by not showing it at all, but from an accessibility point of view I think SHOWING it but DISABLING tells more to a screen reader that just not having anything there.

## What comes next

In [02-todo-app](../02-todo-app/) I'll be adding the feature to cross and uncross each task out.
