# Third todo-app

## Description of the project

This time I had to add local storage feature to this todo-app (what worth will this app have if it couldn't remember your to-dos!)

* For some reason, I was told that it may have something to do with the way Opera GX handles web headers, if you close and restore the tab it will not show correctly your last changes, although the app did save them (you can refresh the page and everything should be OK).

## I learnt

Just got me to practice saving changes to localStorage using side effects and retrieving them correctly to the component state while loading it.

## What comes next

In [04-todo-app](../04-todo-app/) Changes will be saved in a database -to be chosen- instead of localStorage, so wrap it out folks, we're going full stack this time (not really.)
